# Task manager application
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0. It contains a simple friendly user web application for task management purposes. It shows a friendly sober design and a funny user interface. You can create, edit and delete tasks. Each task has a title, subtasks and a priority for ordering. The tasks will be displayed in three different colors depending on their priority. Between subtasks, you should put a ", " so the code can recognize each subtask independently.
The web application was made in french, so sorry in advance for non french users even though there is not much in it that is not explained in this document.
The code answers to most of the web developper rules such as components, interfaces for typing objects and a correct enough architecture.

## Instructions

Make sure you have `node.js` installed in your device. Run first `npm install` so you can install all the dependencies and libraries needed in the project then launch the server with `ng serve` to launch on dev mode. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` on your favorite browser (Google Chrome is highly recommanded) and you are good to go. Enjoy.
